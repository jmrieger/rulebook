    1. Information
        1. The most recent, official version of the NCPA rulebook can be found at http://ncpapaintball.com/rulebook.
        1. It is the responsibility of the players and staff of any and all participating teams to know and understand the rules governing NCPA sanctioned events.
        1. If the meaning of any portion of this rulebook is unclear the simplest interpretation and the one most consistent with the body of the rules is most likely the correct one. Omissions are not loopholes. When examples are provided they are not intended to be the sum of all possibilities, but simply representative examples.
    1. Officiating
        1. Each field’s head referee is the highest authority on that field.
        1. Any call made by the head referee on their field is final.
        1. The Ultimate Referee will not overturn any on-field calls by a head referee.
        1. The Ultimate Referee is the highest authority at an event in regards to play-of-the-game or on field disputes.
            1. The role of the Ultimate Referee at sanctioned events is played by NCPA league officials, who should be contacted during a sanctioned event to resolve questions regarding game rules or enforcement.
        1. Any decision of the Ultimate Referee is final.

                    * Was, during the entirety of the previous semester, enrolled as a full-time student, or would have or did qualify for an Unlimited Full Time Waiver
    2. High School
        1. All players on a team must attend the same high school, with limited exceptions noted below. It is NOT necessary for your team to be officially recognized by your school. The ONLY requirement is that all of your players are eligible.
        2. For private schools, only students who actually attend that school may play on that school’s team. For public schools, the following players are eligible to play on that school’s team:
            1. Any student who is enrolled at that high school.
            2. Any student who attends a ‘magnet’ school, but would attend the public high school if they elected not to attend the magnet school. To be considered a ‘magnet’ school, the school must accept students who would normally go to several different high schools were they not attending the magnet school, and enrollment in the magnet school must be voluntary. Voluntary means that, if the student wanted to, they could leave the magnet school AND they would then attend the team’s public high school.
            3. Any student who is home schooled, but would attend the school if they enrolled in public school.
            4. Any student who is enrolled in junior high school, and will attend the school when they graduate from their junior high school.
        3. NO ONE ELSE is eligible to compete for a high school team.
