        1. It is the responsibility of the players and staff of any and all participating teams to know and understand the rules governing NCPA sanctioned events.
        1. If the meaning of any portion of this rulebook is unclear the simplest interpretation and the one most consistent with the body of the rules is most likely the correct one. Omissions are not loopholes. When examples are provided they are not intended to be the sum of all possibilities, but simply representative examples.

        1. Any call made by the head referee on their field is final.
        1. The Ultimate Referee will not overturn any on-field calls by a head referee.
        1. The Ultimate Referee is the highest authority at an event in regards to play-of-the-game or on field disputes.
            1. The role of the Ultimate Referee at sanctioned events is played by NCPA league officials, who should be contacted during a sanctioned event to resolve questions regarding game rules or enforcement.
        1. Any decision of the Ultimate Referee is final.

    1. High School
        1. All players on a team must attend the same high school, with limited exceptions noted below. It is NOT necessary for your team to be officially recognized by your school. The ONLY requirement is that all of your players are eligible.
        1. For private schools, only students who actually attend that school may play on that school’s team. For public schools, the following players are eligible to play on that school’s team:
            1. Any student who is enrolled at that high school.
            1. Any student who attends a ‘magnet’ school, but would attend the public high school if they elected not to attend the magnet school. To be considered a ‘magnet’ school, the school must accept students who would normally go to several different high schools were they not attending the magnet school, and enrollment in the magnet school must be voluntary. Voluntary means that, if the student wanted to, they could leave the magnet school AND they would then attend the team’s public high school.
            1. Any student who is home schooled, but would attend the school if they enrolled in public school.
            1. Any student who is enrolled in junior high school, and will attend the school when they graduate from their junior high school.
        1. NO ONE ELSE is eligible to compete for a high school team.

# Class AA Season Ranking
4. Class AA Season Ranking
    1. Each team will be ranked in the last division played.
    1. The event score for a team is determined by the formula
    $$ 90 + \frac{\text{Number of Teams Competing} - \text{Your Place}}{\text{Number Of Teams Competing} - 1} + 10 $$

    1. If there is a tie in the number of ranking points,
        1. The team with the highest number of ranking points earned in events in that division in the current season in which the team appeared in the finals will be ranked higher.  If the tie remains after comparing team performance in the finals, compare ranking points earned in events in which the teams were eliminated in the semi-final round, and if still necessary, evens in which the teams were eliminated in the quarterfinal round.
        1. If the first tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest combined margin of victory in the Finals of all tournaments in which the team appeared will be ranked higher.
            1. If a team did not appear in the finals of a particular tournament, count the margin for that tournament as 0.
        1. If the second tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest combined margin of victory in the next earliest round of the events in which the team appeared is ranked higher, comparing successively earlier tournament rounds until the tie is broken.
        1. If the third tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest ranking at the end of the preceding season will be ranked higher.
        1. If the fourth tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team from the school with the smallest undergraduate enrollment will be ranked higher.
