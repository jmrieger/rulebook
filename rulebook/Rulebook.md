        1. If the meaning of any portion of this rulebook is unclear the simplest interpretation and the one most consistent with the body of the rules is most likely the correct one. Omissions are not loopholes. When examples are provided they are not intended to be the sum of all possibilities, but simply representative examples.

        1. Any call made by the head referee on their field is final.
        1. The Ultimate Referee will not overturn any on-field calls by a head referee.
        1. The Ultimate Referee is the highest authority at an event in regards to play-of-the-game or on field disputes.
            1. The role of the Ultimate Referee at sanctioned events is played by NCPA league officials, who should be contacted during a sanctioned event to resolve questions regarding game rules or enforcement.
        1. Any decision of the Ultimate Referee is final.

                    * Was, during the entirety of the previous semester, enrolled as a full-time student, or would have or did qualify for an Unlimited Full Time Waiver
    1. High School
        1. All players on a team must attend the same high school, with limited exceptions noted below. It is NOT necessary for your team to be officially recognized by your school. The ONLY requirement is that all of your players are eligible.
        1. For private schools, only students who actually attend that school may play on that school’s team. For public schools, the following players are eligible to play on that school’s team:
            1. Any student who is enrolled at that high school.
            1. Any student who attends a ‘magnet’ school, but would attend the public high school if they elected not to attend the magnet school. To be considered a ‘magnet’ school, the school must accept students who would normally go to several different high schools were they not attending the magnet school, and enrollment in the magnet school must be voluntary. Voluntary means that, if the student wanted to, they could leave the magnet school AND they would then attend the team’s public high school.
            1. Any student who is home schooled, but would attend the school if they enrolled in public school.
            1. Any student who is enrolled in junior high school, and will attend the school when they graduate from their junior high school.

# Class AA Season Ranking
4. Class AA Season Ranking
    1. Each team will be ranked in the last division played.
    1. The event score for a team is determined by the formula
    $$ 90 + \frac{\text{Number of Teams Competing} - \text{Your Place}}{\text{Number Of Teams Competing} - 1} + 10 $$

    1. If there is a tie in the number of ranking points,
        1. The team with the highest number of ranking points earned in events in that division in the current season in which the team appeared in the finals will be ranked higher.  If the tie remains after comparing team performance in the finals, compare ranking points earned in events in which the teams were eliminated in the semi-final round, and if still necessary, evens in which the teams were eliminated in the quarterfinal round.
        1. If the first tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest combined margin of victory in the Finals of all tournaments in which the team appeared will be ranked higher.
            1. If a team did not appear in the finals of a particular tournament, count the margin for that tournament as 0.
        1. If the second tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest combined margin of victory in the next earliest round of the events in which the team appeared is ranked higher, comparing successively earlier tournament rounds until the tie is broken.
        1. If the third tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team with the highest ranking at the end of the preceding season will be ranked higher.
        1. If the fourth tiebreaker fails to break the tie, the team from the school with the smallest undergraduate enrollment will be ranked higher.

[^competitor]: A competitor is any person present on the field of play equipped to compete in a team’s match during an active point and exhibiting an association with the competing team.

[^same_number_of_teams]: Same number  of teams from each bracket

[^all_tiebreakers]: Including all tiebreakers

[^loose_material]: Subject to specific requirements by the head referee on the field of play as per 5.1.13

[^underclothing_padding]: Any item containing padding of any nature will not be considered underclothing but will be considered protective gear.

[^cleats]: Similar “cleats” are often found on baseball cleat.

[^headwear_example]: As an example, one sandanna and one beanie or one headband and one sandanna.

[^oversided_clothing_how_to_measure]: The article of clothing should be grabbed at a single point and pulled away from the body or limb. Once this has been done, the clothing should be pinched on opposite sides of this point so these two points are brought together next to the body or limb.  The clothing will then be tight around the body or limb, with any extra clothing pulled through the pinch and held at the original grab point.

[^astm_goggles]: Goggle manufacturers must submit independent laboratory test results to the promoter at least 10 days prior to the start of a tournament demonstrating the goggle system meets or exceeds ASTM standards for any system such manufacturer wishes to be allowed for use during that tournament.

[^cracks_are_bad_mmkay]: Cracks in the lens, however slight, affect the ability of the goggles to protect the player.

[^no_penalty_for_losing_mask]: This does not apply to players who accidentally lose their mask during an active point.

[^goggle_accessories_are_ok]: Goggle fans and decorative additions that are not padded or absorbent are acceptable.

[^padding_hits_are_majors]: Hits on padding are obvious and subject to a major penalty.  Players should not wear so much padding that they cannot feel hits.

[^no_hair_triggers]: They may operate if and only if the trigger is pulled, and shall not fire if it is hit, dropped, shaken or sneezed on.

[^electronic_components]: Batteries, circuit boards, chips, wires, etc…

[^ramping_description]: If the trigger is pulled one, two or three times, the marker shall fire no more than the number of times the trigger is pulled. Essentially any marker capable of ramping must shoot three rounds in semi-auto before ramping. The marker may then fire up to three balls per pull after that. Specifically, if more than one second has elapsed since the last shot and the trigger is pulled three times only three paintball may be fired. 

[^mechanical_trigger_release]: Once the marker is fired, the player must reduce the force applied to the trigger and allow the trigger to travel forward past the firing point and then reapply the force on the trigger and bring the trigger back past the firing point before the marker may fire again, i.e., no bounce.

[^no_reactive_triggers]: No reactive triggers.  The trigger force may change as the position of the trigger changes, but the force exerted against the trigger finger at any given trigger position should not change, for example, as a result of the marker firing.

[^tournament_locks]: Essentially, anything that can adjust velocity, shot mode, de-bounce, etc., must be locked.

[^air_tank_removal]: This exception only applies to screwing in or unscrewing the air source – any settings on the air tank itself must not be adjustable without the use of tools.
